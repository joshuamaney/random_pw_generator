# random_pw_generator
The random password generator allows the user to create a secure password with just a few clicks of the mouse.  The User is prompted to first choose a desired length for their new password. The number must be between 8 and 128 or an alert will be triggered, telling the user to select a valid length. If a valid number is selected, the user will then be asked to confirm a series of parameters for their new password:

1. should the password include uppercase characters?
2. should the password include lowercase characters?
3. should the password include numbers?
4. should the password include special characters?

The user can select any number of these options with which to create their password, but if at least one option is not selected, another alert will ask them to do so.  

Once the password variables are selected, a new, secure password will appear in the text box provided for the user to copy.
